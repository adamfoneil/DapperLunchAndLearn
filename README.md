This is intended for a live demo using [DotNetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to learn [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper), a great library for working with SQL in C#.

To setup your fiddle environment, add the NuGet package **AO.DapperLunchAndLearn** and you'll be able to do these exercises.
