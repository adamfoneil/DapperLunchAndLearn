This is intended for a live demo using [DotNetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) to learn [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper), a great library for working with SQL in C#.

To setup your fiddle environment, add the NuGet package **AO.DapperLunchAndLearn** and you'll be able to do these exercises.

# The database schema

To do anything with Dapper, you need a database to play with. I've created something really simple to store music metadata.

These tables were built from these [model classes](https://github.com/adamfoneil/DapperLunchAndLearn/tree/master/DapperLunchAndLearn/Models).

# Exercises

All of the exercises below require this first statement:

```csharp
using Dapper;
using DapperLunchAndLearn;
using DapperLunchAndLearn.Models;

using var cn = Connection.Open();
```

<details>
<summary>Ex 1: A simple insert</summary>

```csharp
await cn.ExecuteAsync("INSERT INTO [Artist] ([Name], [CreatedBy]) VALUES (@Name, @CreatedBy)", new Artist()
{
    Name = "Talking Heads",
    CreatedBy = "adamo"
});
```
</details>
